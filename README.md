# **Analysis of the US Economy - Part 3 - ver. 2**

## **Introduction**

In the third part of this study, we answer the questions: what are the prospects for the US economy and under what conditions would the debt-to-GDP ratio reach 175%. This percentage is considered a critical point beyond which the sustainability of the economy is already in question. Several additional trends are also outlined, relevant conclusions are drawn.
